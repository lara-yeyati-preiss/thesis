## Synopsis

Space is immense, overpowering, boundless. So, how do we make sense of it? What do we project onto the infinite? 

This study examines space as a cultural and political object where imagination, power, economics, and scientific progress intersect. It visualizes how outer space has been framed across media, politics, and culture from the 1950s to the present. 

At the core of the analysis is a framing taxonomy: exploration and science, power and rivalry, risk and hazard, economic activity, and cosmic meaning. Where relevant, this pairs with an actor taxonomy to analyze who is positioned at the core of each narrative: states (national and international), scientific institutions, private firms, individuals. 

The project works across several layers. Media coverage draws from New York Times articles via their Article Search API, tracking how space is presented publicly: as a race, a technological triumph, a disaster, a commercial frontier. A second layer examines space-related films via TMDB to capture how space is imagined in popular culture. Political rhetoric draws from the American Presidency Project database to reveal how administrations frame space across time. A background layer provides ambient infrastructure: launch counts, planet discoveries, landmark dates—the material baseline against which narrative analysis can be contextualized. 

The overarching purpose of this project is to examine how societies approach something as infinite as space as both our knowledge and cultural frameworks evolve. By tracking scientific milestones alongside shifting narrative patterns, the project visualizes space not only as concrete a material reality but also as a mirror of what we think is possible and how we position ourselves within the cosmos.


## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Outer Space as a Political and Cultural Object
Space is an inherently boundless, ineffable realm. Yet despite—or because of—its incomprehensibility, we tend to approach it through a distinctly human lens: as something to conquer, a source of awe, an arena for geopolitical rivalry, a mirror for self-reflection. This project examines outer space as a sphere where imagination, power, economics, and technological capability intersect.

Space has long been an object of transdisciplinary inquiry precisely because it operates simultaneously across multiple registers: it is at once material (satellites, budgets, launches) and symbolic (national power, existential threat, cosmic meaning). It functions as a key part of what are called sociotechnical imaginaries, which refer to how a society's shared visions of the future shape its scientific and technological developments (Jasanoff and Kim 2009; Hendriks, Karhunmaa, and Delvenne 2025). At the same time, scholars have examined space as an arena of geopolitical competition and power projection (Dolman 2002; Siddiqi 2010), while others have focused on the role of communication and media in shaping public support for space programs (Kauffman 1994). More recently, perspectives regarding the privatization of space endeavors have emerged (Ward 2019; Nam 2023).

What these diverse approaches share is a recognition that space is continuously constructed through discourse, policy, spectacle, and imagination. By developing a unified analytical framework to examine how outer space has been framed across media coverage, political rhetoric, and popular culture from the 1950s to the present, this project seeks to address key questions central to this perspective, such as: How do narrative framings of space shift in relation to material developments? How do key actors transform as we move from Cold War competition to commercial spaceflight?


### 1.2. The Space Age as an Arena of Competing Narratives
The space age was officially inaugurated with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, marking humanity's first sustained material engagement with outer space. Yet the space age is not a single coherent era: it is marked by shifts in logic, purpose, and form. In its initial phase, it was dominated by Cold War nationalism. Space became a battlefield on which to project not only technical but also ideological and political power. The Apollo program illustrates this logic: a state-led initiative justified primarily through geopolitical competition, even as it was also narrated through language of human achievement and cosmic prowess (citation TBD).

Following the Cold War's end, space narratives shifted internationally as nations responded to new geopolitical realities. In the United States—the focus of this study—there was a reorientation toward pragmatism and internationalism (citation TBD). The International Space Station exemplifies this post-Cold War cooperation, even as tensions persisted. This era also revealed space as fallible and vulnerable, with events like the Challenger and Columbia disasters. In recent years, alongside the persistence of geopolitical framings, there has been a rise of commercial space actors and a partial privatization of what was once an exclusive domain of national governments. Private companies have reframed space through entrepreneurial language of innovation and markets, while also positioning space as a site of potential colonization and resource extraction (Ward 2019; Nam 2023).

These shifts raise questions about how societies imagine and approach space. Is the transition from state-led to commercial space simply a change in form, or does it represent a fundamental reframing of how we think about space and our relationship to it? How do different actors—governments, corporations, scientific institutions, individuals—fit into these shifting narratives and approaches to space? And how do popular cultural representations intersect with or diverge from political and media framings?

This paper focuses on tracking these narrative shifts across multiple discursive layers. It examines how the same material object (outer space) is constructed through different genres and institutions: media coverage, political rhetoric, and cultural imagination. By analyzing these layers in parallel, the study seeks to reveal how discourse about space aligns and fractures across domains.

### 1.3. Data Sources and Scope
This project employs a mixed-methods approach to examine how space is constructed across multiple discursive domains. It analyzes three distinct layers of discourse using a framing taxonomy designed to capture how space is narrated: as exploration and science, power and rivalry, risk and hazard, economic activity, or cosmic meaning. While these frames are not perfectly exhaustive or mutually exclusive, they provide systematic categories for tracking key changes over time. Selected layers also employ an actor taxonomy identifying who is positioned as central: states, international bodies, scientific institutions, private firms, individual entrepreneurs, or no specific actor.

Discursive data sources (1950s to the present):
Layer 1: Articles from The New York Times collected via the NYT Article Search API serve as a proxy for elite mainstream media coverage, providing a consistent historical record of how space is presented publicly.
Layer 2: Speeches, press releases, and policy statements from the American Presidency Project database capture how government administrations institutionally frame space.
Layer 3: Space-related films identified through the TMDB API capture how space is represented in popular cultural imagination.
Along with these three discursive analyses, there is a background layer tracking concrete milestones that serve as a proxy for our development in space technology and science: launch counts, human spaceflight events, planet discoveries, and major landmarks. This provides the material context against which narrative framings can be interpreted.
Additionally, as a supplementary component, the project presents a timeline of cultural artifacts sent into space, documenting not only how we speak about space among ourselves but how we present ourselves outward.
